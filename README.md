# discordBotPantufa
This is a custom discord bot I am creating for a server my friends and I use. It is not meant to be public.

# What does it do?

- It creates teams for a League of Legends scrimmage based on the users' skill (skill is defined when adding the user to the database).
- It has a database for chess players on our chess server, it tracks wins, losses, and ties.
- Reminds everyone if today is a Holiday/Special Event, everyone can check when the next events are.
- Reminds certain people that shared their timetable when they have class and people can check their timetable with commands as well.
- Updates the value of certain cryptocurrencies on a text channel, everyone can check the value of a certain cryptocurrency via commands as well
- Lets close friends tweet with commands in my Twitter account


# What might come in the future?

- Extra functionalities with crypto
- More interactions with different APIs
- More moderation commands
- Might create a public bot with most functionalities...
